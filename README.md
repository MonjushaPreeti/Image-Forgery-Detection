# Image-Forgery-Detection

Image Forgery Detection is designed to identify two primary types of active image manipulation: copy-move and splicing. The system leverages a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classifier, utilizing Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for effective feature extraction.
